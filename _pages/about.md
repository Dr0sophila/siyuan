I am a 2nd year M.S. student in Computer Science at the University of Florida. Before this, I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science from Fuzhou University in 2022.

My research interest lies in deep learning and generative models.

Iâ€™m always excited to explore collaborative opportunities - feel free to reach out!
